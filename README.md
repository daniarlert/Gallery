# Generative Art Gallery

This repository contains the source code (mainly for Processing) and the source files (like TouchDesigner files) of all or almost all the projects you can see on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daniarlert/) account. Inside of each folder I'm adding information about each project itself, inspirations and tutorials or resources if any were used.

## Crediting and NFTs:

> I'm against NFTs so I DO NOT AUTHORIZE in any way the use of any of my work to generate or sell NFTs. Legally of course there is nothing I can do, but please, don't use my work to deceive people.

I would appreciate any mention if any of the projects here have inspired you or have been the base for any of your own work. But this is not required if you do not want to.

## Tools

I mainly use two tools to create generative art:
- [Processing](https://processing.org/).
- [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Install_TouchDesigner).

In the future I plan to use (or just play with) Blender. But the tools you can use are endless.

## Why Processing and not p5.js

On many occasions I have found that the performance of p5.js wat not adequate for what I wanted and want to do. Whereas with Processing I have found a more than acceptable performance for all of my work.
